2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

* When coding the Light and Sound Memory Game pre-work I noticed a major challenge of giving up too easily when working. The reason why I felt like giving up easily, is because I did not understand javascript, html and css, however I found it interesting the more I was able to continue throughout the prework, which kept me going. I kept running into small roadblocks like redesigning the buttons or figuring out how to make a secret pattern every time the game started but I persevered by reading documentation on google, w3schools, books, etc. For example I read through w3schools, when designing the buttons to learn that you can change certain sections of our css file to modify the background image when a specific button is activated. Additionally,  a similar situation occurred when figuring out how to develop a secret random pattern when the game started. I read through w3schools and html websites to figure out how to make a separate function, use arrays, and while loops to generate a random pattern. I solved this by using a while loop to iterate through the n length of the pattern, generating a random number between 1 - nth largest button for each pattern. These two challenges were important to me because it taught me new skills in html, css and javascript along with how to solve these multiple roadblocks by using resources across the internet to finish the pre-work. Overall I enjoyed working on the Light and Sound Memory game because it taught me to keep continuing although it may be difficult. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

* After completing my submission I have only a few questions. By working through the pre-work I noticed that under the description there are a few technologies covered like React, Node, Express and MongoDB. I would love to know more about these technologies progressing through web development, and how they would apply into the real world. Why are these technologies useful to web development compared to html, css and javascript? How would they work when working on other projects? Additionally, I noticed that people will be working in different areas and would like to know what is the difference between Fullstack developers, Backend Developers and Frontend Developers? Will people be separated into different areas of web development? I would love to know some answers to these questions.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
